## ADDITIONAL GOALS 
1. use the wrongCardArr to randomize the joker displayed on wrong guess
  - why? will return different jokers when 
  - how?? I can seem to grab the random image from the array but cannot get the image to populate on the wrong guess

2. make the images clickable to replace the buttons
  - Why? gives user the feeling of selecting the actual card vs clicking a button
  - How? 
    * onclick function? tried but not entirely understanding
    * tried adding an anchor and link option but nothing happened (no link destination)

3. add animation to card images
  - Why? give the cards the look of being shuffled between each turn 
  - How? 
    * tried adding a css class with keyframes animation but image remained static
    * other options???
